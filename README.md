# Travell-application-design-using-figma


This is a group project completed as a result of a completing a course at the University. Here UI/UX design was taught and for the project we were asked to create any type of Application. We went for a mobile application for travelling assistance and designs can be seen in `https://www.figma.com/proto/7RTkWoyWl0fjMmc7OG4wqk/Social-comp-group-20?node-id=1-1038&node-type=canvas&t=xNzjNIQp17DVZx9x-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2443`
